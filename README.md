# Quarkus Microservices Training
Coursework and notes for a software traing to setting up, presenting, and animating lab exercises for the 4-day course on using Quarkus to develop clean and efficient microservices

## Labs
The bulk of the work and setup is in preparing and presenting the course labs. The labs are designed to be run through by the participants before presenting the solutions and the concepts that have been demonstrated. In this way, the participant learns with a "Code First, Theory Later" workflow.

## Slides
The slides are constructed using Marp in order to be markdown-like and easy to modify/adjust in a programmable and git-diff-friendly manner.
