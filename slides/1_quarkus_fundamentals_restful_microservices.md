---

## Morning Session 1 (09:00 - 10:30)

- **Topic**: Getting Started with Quarkus
- **Activity**: Hands-on Lab 1
- **Goal**: Set up a complete development environment and build your first Quarkus application.

---

## Lab 1 Objectives

- Create a new Quarkus REST application.
- Implement a custom REST endpoint for the train line's status.
- Experience key developer joy features like live reload and continuous testing.
- Test the custom REST endpoint.
- Manage the project's source code with Git.

---

## Morning Session 2 (10:45 - 12:15)

- **Topic**: Debriefing Lab 1 & Core Concepts
- **Focus**: Reviewing the lab, understanding REST principles in Quarkus, and exploring the testing framework.

---

## Debrief: Train Line Service REST

- **REST Endpoint**: `StatusResource` using Jakarta REST (JAX-RS) annotations (`@Path`, `@GET`).
  - [RESTEasy Reactive Guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/resteasy-reactive)
- **Project Structure**: A closer look at `pom.xml` and the role of Quarkus extensions.
  - [Maven Tooling](https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling#managing-dependencies)
- **Testing**: `StatusResourceTest` validates the endpoint using RestAssured.
  - [Testing with RestAssured](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#testing-the-application)

---

## Debrief: Development & Testing Tools

- **Live Reload**: Quarkus automatically recompiles changes in dev mode.
- **Continuous Testing**: The benefits of instant feedback on code changes.
  - [Continuous Testing](https://quarkus.io/guides/continuous-testing)
- **Dev Services**: Quarkus can automatically provision services like databases for development and testing (to be explored in later labs).
  - [Dev Services Overview](https://quarkus.io/guides/dev-services)

---

## Afternoon Session 1 (13:15 - 15:00)

- **Topic**: Introduction to Quarkus and Microservices
- **Goal**: Understand the philosophy behind Quarkus and its role in modern microservices architecture.

---

## What is Quarkus?

- **Philosophy**: "Supersonic Subatomic Java" - A Kubernetes-native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards.
  - [The Vision](https://quarkus.io/vision/supersonic-subatomic-java)
- **Cloud-Native Approach**: Optimized for fast startup times and low memory usage, making it ideal for containers and serverless.
- **Standards-Based**: Built on standards like Jakarta EE and MicroProfile, with a rich ecosystem of extensions.

---

## Quarkus in the Ecosystem

- **Comparison**:
  - vs. **Spring Boot**: Quarkus offers faster boot times and lower memory footprint due to its build-time optimizations.
  - vs. **Jakarta EE**: Provides a more modern, streamlined, and developer-friendly experience for cloud-native development.
- **Why Quarkus for Cloud?**: Excels in environments like Kubernetes and Serverless due to its resource efficiency and rapid scaling.
  - [Quarkus on Kubernetes](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes)
  - [Quarkus on AWS Lambda](https://quarkus.io/guides/amazon-lambda)

---

## What are Microservices?

- **Architectural Principles**: A style of architecture that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.
  - Key principles include Single Responsibility, Bounded Contexts, and Decentralized Governance.
- **Decoupling & Deployment**: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, enabling faster release cycles and greater resilience.

---

## Introduction to MicroProfile

- **Purpose**: An open-source specification for building enterprise Java microservices, standardizing features across different vendor implementations.
  - [MicroProfile in Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/guides/microprofile)
- **Quarkus & MicroProfile**: Quarkus provides a highly efficient and optimized implementation of the MicroProfile specifications.
- **Implementation**: Many of the MicroProfile APIs in Quarkus are provided by the [SmallRye](https://smallrye.io/) project.

---

## Key MicroProfile & Quarkus APIs

- **MicroProfile Specs**:
  - [Config](https://quarkus.io/guides/microprofile-config): Externalize configuration.
  - [Health](https://quarkus.io/guides/microprofile-health): Expose health checks.
  - [Metrics](https://quarkus.io/guides/microprofile-metrics): Provide monitoring data.
  - [REST Client](https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-client-reactive): Type-safe REST invocation.
  - [Fault Tolerance](https://quarkus.io/guides/microprofile-fault-tolerance): Build resilient services.
- **Core Quarkus Extensions**:
  - [RESTEasy Reactive](https://quarkus.io/guides/resteasy-reactive): For building reactive REST APIs.
  - [Hibernate ORM with Panache](https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache): Simplifies data access.
  - [OpenAPI & Swagger UI](https://quarkus.io/guides/openapi-swaggerui): Generate API documentation.

---

## Afternoon Session 2 (15:00 - 16:00)

- **Topic**: Deploying a Microservice
- **Activity**: Hands-on Lab 2
- **Goal**: Build and configure a simple REST microservice from scratch.

---

## Lab 2 Objectives

- Add logging to a REST endpoint and debug a running application.
- Externalize and dynamically configure microservice properties.
- Override configuration for different environments.
- Build a native container image for the application.
